# Multi-objective Pathfinding & Optimisation

### How to install the problem in PlatEmo?
If not already there (MaOPP Problem), insert the contents to the respective problem folder in PlatEmo (use the path information).

### How to use the problem in PlatEmo?
If you inserted everything correctly, after starting PlatEmo, you should see ```MaOPP_real``` and ```MaOPP_binary``` in the list of problems. Change the settings as wanted. Keep in mind, that you don't need to assign a value to ```M``` or ```D``` as these values are computed according to the settings. However, ```M``` is usually ```5``` and will be changeable in a future version. All other options are explained in the respective paper [1,2] and in the respective problem classes in PlatEmo.

### What should I do if it does not work or if I have questions?

### A note on the reference fronts
Please keep it mind, that a newer version of the reference fronts might be available at [the benchmark's website](https://ci.ovgu.de/Publications/Scalable+Many_Objective+Pathfinding+Benchmark+Suite-p-910.html) as I am continuously computing more of them.
